# IoT-based Mushroom Cultivation Device
This was my Exhibition Project that I showcased at INAGRITECH 2023 on August 23 - 25, 2023.

This prototype was made for growing any mushroom at home. 

## How It Works
Air humidity, air temperature, and light intensity are being monitored and controlled using IoT Technology. 

With these parameter specifications:
• Air humidity: 70 % - 95 %
• Air temperature: 20 °C - 25 °C
• Light intensity: 300 lx - 500 lx

This range parameter specification can be adjusted according to the type of mushroom being chosen.
